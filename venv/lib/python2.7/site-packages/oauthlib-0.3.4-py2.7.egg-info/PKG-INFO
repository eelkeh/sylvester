Description: OAuthLib
        ========
        
        *A generic, spec-compliant, thorough implementation of the OAuth request-signing
        logic.*
        
        .. image:: https://secure.travis-ci.org/idangazit/oauthlib.png?branch=master
        
        OAuth often seems complicated and difficult-to-implement. There are several
        prominent libraries for signing OAuth requests, but they all suffer from one or
        both of the following:
        
        1. They predate the `OAuth 1.0 spec`_, AKA RFC 5849.
        2. They assume the usage of a specific HTTP request library.
        
        .. _`OAuth 1.0 spec`: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849
        
        OAuthLib is a generic utility which implements the logic of OAuth without
        assuming a specific HTTP request object. Use it to graft OAuth support onto your
        favorite HTTP library. If you're a maintainer of such a library, write a thin
        veneer on top of OAuthLib and get OAuth support for very little effort.

        Interested in making OAuth requests?
        ------------------------------------
        
        Then you might be more interested in using `requests`_ which has OAuthLib 
        powered OAuth support built-in. See the `requests OAuth examples`_ for
        how you can get started.
